# Taskify Backend - Clean Architecture Refactoring

## Overview
This project has been successfully refactored from a monolithic structure to follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and proper dependency direction.

## New Project Structure

```
/Taskify
├── src/
│   ├── Taskify.Domain/           → Core business models and entities
│   ├── Taskify.Application/      → Use cases, commands, queries, and interfaces
│   ├── Taskify.Infrastructure/   → Data access, external services, implementations
│   └── Taskify.Web/              → API controllers and presentation layer
└── tests/
    └── Taskify.Tests/            → Unit and integration tests
```

## Dependency Direction (Clean Architecture Rules)
- ✅ **Web** → **Application** → **Domain**
- ✅ **Infrastructure** → **Application**
- ✅ Domain has no dependencies on other layers
- ✅ Application depends only on Domain
- ✅ Infrastructure implements Application interfaces

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Domain Layer (Taskify.Domain)**
- Clean domain entities without EF attributes
- Proper enums with meaningful names
- Business logic separated from data concerns
- No external dependencies

### 2. **Application Layer (Taskify.Application)**
- CQRS pattern with MediatR
- Feature-based folder organization
- Clear interfaces for external dependencies
- DTOs for data transfer
- Vertical slicing by features (Users, Tasks, Projects, etc.)

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer (Taskify.Infrastructure)**
- EF Core DbContext with proper mappings
- Service implementations (AuthService, EmailService)
- External API integrations (Google Auth, BCrypt)
- Dependency injection configuration

### 4. **Web Layer (Taskify.Web)**
- Thin controllers that delegate to Application layer
- Proper dependency injection setup
- CORS configuration
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

## Technologies & Patterns Used

### Core Technologies
- **.NET 9.0** - Latest framework version
- **Entity Framework Core** - Data access with PostgreSQL
- **MediatR** - CQRS and Mediator pattern implementation
- **BCrypt.Net** - Password hashing
- **JWT** - Authentication tokens
- **Google APIs** - OAuth integration

### Architectural Patterns
- **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns with proper dependencies
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Mediator Pattern** - Decoupled request/response handling
- **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling and testability

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before (Issues Fixed)
❌ Mixed responsibilities in controllers  
❌ EF attributes polluting domain models  
❌ Tight coupling between layers  
❌ Business logic in infrastructure  
❌ Hard to test and maintain  

### After (Clean Architecture Benefits)
✅ Single Responsibility Principle  
✅ Clean domain models  
✅ Loose coupling with interfaces  
✅ Business logic in Application layer  
✅ Easily testable and maintainable  
✅ Scalable architecture  

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- PostgreSQL database
- Your favorite IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)

### 2. Configuration
Update `appsettings.json` in the Web project:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=taskify_clean;Username=postgres;Password=your_password"
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "your-secret-key-here-make-it-long-enough-for-security",
    "Issuer": "TaskifyAPI"
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Run
```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build Taskify.sln

# Run the API
cd src/Taskify.Web
dotnet run

# Access Swagger UI
# Navigate to: https://localhost:5001/swagger
```

## What's Next

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Add more CQRS features** - Complete Commands for Create/Update/Delete operations
2. **Implement validation** - FluentValidation for request validation
3. **Add authentication middleware** - JWT authentication setup
4. **Create more controllers** - Tasks, Projects, Comments, etc.
5. **Add logging** - Structured logging with Serilog

### Advanced Features
1. **Unit tests** - Comprehensive test coverage
2. **Integration tests** - API endpoint testing
3. **Event sourcing** - For audit trails
4. **Background services** - Email notifications, file processing
5. **API versioning** - Support multiple API versions
6. **Rate limiting** - Protect against abuse
7. **Caching** - Redis for performance

## Benefits of This Architecture

### For Development Team
- **Clear boundaries** - Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Easy testing** - Interfaces allow easy mocking
- **Parallel development** - Teams can work on different layers independently
- **Code reuse** - Business logic is centralized and reusable

### For Maintenance
- **Easier debugging** - Clear flow of dependencies
- **Flexible technology changes** - Swap implementations without affecting business logic
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new features following established patterns
- **Documentation** - Self-documenting architecture

### For Business
- **Faster time to market** - Well-structured code means faster development
- **Lower maintenance costs** - Clean code is easier to maintain
- **Better quality** - Separation of concerns reduces bugs
- **Future-proof** - Architecture supports growth and changes

This refactoring sets a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and testable task management application.
